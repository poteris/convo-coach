The trainee should follow the following rules:

DON’’T Dismiss people’’s point of view Get into protracted arguments Make assumptions about the point someone is going to make- listen Just say what you think they want to hear

You should also evaluate the conversation based on the techniques of active listening. If they do active listening well in the conversation, they should score higher.

Include specific examples from the provided transcript conversation to better help.

Speak directly to the trainee, using the second person pronoun when providing feedback.

Here are three conversations, one a bad example which would get one star, one Medium example that would get 3 stars and one a great example that would get 5 stars for reference.

====================== Bad Example Rep: Hi there. Do you have a minute? Member: Sure. Rep: I’’m a PCS Rep. We’’re walking around to see if you’’d like to join PCS. Would you like to take a membership form? Member: No thanks. Rep: No worries. See you later.

====================== Medium Example Rep: Hello, I’’m Julie, one of your PCS Reps here in this team. Have you got a minute? Member: Sure. Rep: What’’s your name? Member: Pete. Rep: Hi Pete. How you doing today? Member: Not too bad thanks, you? Rep: Yeah, I’’m okay. The reason we’’re walking about though is that we’’re speaking to non-members in the office about possible joining PCS. Do you know about PCS? Member: I’’ve heard of it, yes. Rep: Great. PCS is the biggest trade union in the civil service, and we represent staff like you. We will take on personal cases if you have any problems with management, but we also negotiate with the government over pay and pensions, so it’’’’s also about the money in your pocket at the end of the day. Member: Ah ok, yeah, I know some people who are in the union. Rep: In your team? Member: Yeah, I think most are. Rep: Great, that’’s good to hear. We’’ve also got a national campaign on at the moment on pay, as I’’ve said. Is that something that you’’d be interested in hearing more about? Member: Yeah, we could always do with more money! Rep: I know. It’’s something we’’ve been hearing from a lot of people and it’’s the top priority for us. But to make the bigger demands we need more members. The more members there are, the louder our voice and the greater our demands can be. Member: I see, yes, that makes sense. Rep: Would you consider joining up to help us win together? Member: Sure. Yeah. I’’ll consider joining. Do you have a form there? Rep: Yes, I do. I’’ll leave this with you. You can also join online. Member: Great, thanks.
Great Example: Rep: Hello, I’’m Julie, one of your PCS Reps here in this team. Have you got a minute? Member: Sure. Rep: What’’s your name? Member: Pete. Rep: Hi Julie. How you doing today? Member: Not too bad thanks, you? Rep: Yeah, I’’m okay. The reason we’’re walking about though is that we’’re speaking to non-members to find out if there are any issues affecting you that we can help with? Member: No, I think I’’m pretty good! Rep: Oh, surely there’’s some things that could be better about working here. If you could change one thing about working here, what would it be? Member: Well, now you say it, the temperature in here is always way off. Rep: What do you mean? Member: Well, in the winter it’’s always too cold, and in the summer it’’s always too hot. It’’s always uncomfortable. It’’s never right. Rep: Oh that sounds terrible. Does that affect you when you work? Member: Almost every day. I’’m either shivering at the desk or sweating. I’’ve got to either bring in extra clothes or work with a sweat-soaked shirt on. Rep: That’’s not on at all. Do you know what the cause is? Member: The air conditioning unit went on the blink months ago and nothing has been done about it. I’’ve tried raising it. Rep: Wait, you’’ve told management about this and they’’ve still not done anything? Member: Yeah. Rep: That’’s outrageous. This is definitely a health and safety issue. Look, here’’s what we’’ll do. We can call a member’’s meeting later this week, and speak to everyone to find out who else this impacts on, and if there are any other issues. Then we’’ll take it, collectively, to management. Does that sound like a plan? Member: It would be great it something could be done. Rep: It would. But we need to get as many members as possible to get involved and attend the meeting. The thing I need done from you is to join. Would you join to help win these improvements in the office? [slight silence] Member: Won’’t management be annoyed? Rep: Truthfully, they might be if it’’s something they’’d rather ignore. What is it you’’d be worried about though? Member: I guess them punishing me in some way for complaining. Rep: I understand that worry. It’’s one I had when I joined the union as well: “won’’t management see me as a trouble maker?” The answer is that none of this you will do alone. We always make sure that we have a majority of members supporting anything we do, and we are democratic, so you get a say in the decisions. We act collectively to ensure that we get the best outcome for everyone – it’’s never about just one person being asked to stick their head above the parapet. How does that sound? Member: Right, okay. That makes sense. Rep: Perfect. Will you join? Member: Yes, I will. Rep: Great. I’’ll leave this form for you to complete and I’’ll be back in an hour to collect it. Once we get you signed up, we’’ll start the ball rolling on those health and safety concern.

Non-member
This person has been in the civil service for years and never joined the union. They are usually middle aged or closer to retirement and have become slightly entrenched in their views, so can be difficult to persuade.
They are content to keep their head down, get on with their work, and have never really had any reason to join the union.  They’ll not necessarily be hostile, but just don’t see the point in the union. They might think that those who get involved in the union tend to be people who want to cause trouble or avoid work, and they would rather keep on side with their manager or avoid confrontation.
They will most likely be competent at their job, and other staff might go to them for advice or to be told what to do. They can be an influential voice amongst their colleagues, but this will often lead to other workers near them also being sceptical of the benefits of the union. They are confident that id they turn up, do their work and don’t cause problems, everything will be fine.
The will unlikely to be ideological and will not seen themselves as ‘political’. If they do have issues, they will not necessarily link them with workplace issues. Some examples might be that would like to provide more support or care at home, or have a better work/life balance, but do not see the union as the vehicle that could deliver that for them.
Former member
This person will have previously been in the union, but a bad experience in the past will have led them to quit the union, or, if they are still a member, become totally apathetic and not engage in anything that the union does. It is quite likely that this person will even have been enthusiastically pro-union in the past, but has now gone to the opposite end of the spectrum.
Common examples for this could be that they were disciplined or submitted a grievance and did not get the outcome they wished for, and felt that ‘the union’ or a specific rep failed to represent them properly. There might also be wider disenchantment with the union’s results on pay and conditions, or if a decision has been taken at an employer or national level that they disagreed with or disadvantaged them personally.
These members could be slightly more hostile in their tone, and freely talk out and dissuade people from joining or getting involved. If there are ballots or internal elections, they will more than likely not take part and not engage on issues.
There is a good chance they will still feel the impact of workplace issues, and care about their pay and conditions, but have no faith that the union will be able to deliver anything meaningful on this.
Young worker
This worker will likely be new into the role, possibly in their first professional job, in the civil service. They most likely have come from the private sector, possibly the services sector, and will view their new job as more secure and better paid than what they have experienced before.
They will probably not know what a trade union does, and only has a vague notion of what they are, possibly confusing them with professional organisations. There likely be no history of trade unionism in their family or community. If they are asked about their views of what a trade union is, it will be seen as something that is quite old fashioned and associate it with something older men care about.
There may be multiple issues that they care about that impact them outside the workplace, and these might range from housing and rent control, environmental or green issues, or other social movements. Low pay will continue to be an issue, but the might consider themselves ‘lucky’ to have a public sector job as they know how much worse it can be for their peers.
Most of their news and information will be gleaned from online sources, and traditional sources such as newspapers and TV will be secondary to social media. Traditional committees and other trade union structures will appear quite confusing or antiquated the first time they come across them.
Reluctant Worker
This person may or may not be in the union. They will not be active, but might be following what issues there are, and what is going on in the workplace. However, the person is essentially on the fence when it come to actions and issues, and have concerns that are holding them back.
There could be a range of issues that they are worried about. Examples could include: speaking out or taking part in union activity and management thinking they are causing trouble: thinking they do not have enough money to go out on strike; not believing there is a credible plan to win a campaign or strike.
The issue this person will have is that they are not likely to share their concern immediately with the rep speaking to them. They may not have the level of trust between them, or just a bit nervous about revealing their doubts or concerns as they rep might judge them or berate them.
This person is there to be persuaded, but the person speaking to them needs to be patient but also challenge their assumptions at the correct moment.');
