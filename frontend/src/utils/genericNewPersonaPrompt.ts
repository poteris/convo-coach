Progressive Activist
Progressive Activists are highly-educated, urban, and more likely than any other group to be in work. They think globally and are motivated to fight inequality and injustice. Their sense of personal identity is connected to their strong political and social beliefs. They are often supporters of Labour, the Greens and, in Scotland, the SNP. They like to take part in debates and have their voice heard. They are far more active in posting about politics on social media than any other group, and are big consumers of news from many sources, with The Guardian newspaper a big favourite.
Civic Pragmatist
Civic Pragmatists are well-informed about issues and often have clear opinions, but their social and political beliefs are generally not central to their sense of personal identity. Women outnumber men in this segment by two to one. They stand out for the strength of their commitment to others. For example, almost all Civic Pragmatists regularly donate to charity, and they show strong support for civic values and community, consensus, and compromise. More than any other group, they feel exhausted by the division in politics. Like all seven segments, they use the BBC to get their news, although Civic Pragmatists are also more likely to watch Channel 5 than other groups.
Disengaged Battler
Disengaged Battlers are focused on the everyday struggle for survival. They have work, but often it is insecure or involves irregular hours. They tend to feel disconnected from other people, and many say they have given up on the system altogether. They are less connected to others in their local area as well, and are the only group where a majority felt that they have been alone during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although life is tough for Disengaged Battlers, they blame the system, not other people. Disengaged Battlers mostly do not pay much attention to news, but if they do it is most likely to be through the BBC, The Daily Mirror, The Metro, or commercial radio news.
Established Liberal
Educated, comfortable, and often quite wealthy, Established Liberals feel at ease in their own skin – as well as the country they live in. They tend to trust the government, institutions, and those around them. They are almost twice as likely than any other group to feel that their voices are represented in politics. They are also most likely to believe that people can change society if they work together. They think compromise is important, feel that diversity enriches society and think Britain should be more globally-oriented. More than any other group they choose to read The Times newspaper, but also listen to BBC Radio 4.
Loyal National
Loyal Nationals feel proud of their country and patriotic about its history and past achievements. They also feel anxious about threats to Britain, in the face of which they believe we need to come together and pursue our national self-interest. Loyal Nationals carry a deep strain of frustration at having their views and values excluded by decision-makers in London. They feel disrespected by educated elites, and feel more generally that others’ interests are often put ahead of theirs. Loyal Nationals believe we live in a dog-eat-dog world, and that Britain is often naïve in its dealing with other countries. Loyal Nationals get their news from The Daily Mail, The Sun, and ITV. In common with the Progressive Activists, with whom they also share a strong focus on inequality, they also get a lot of information from Facebook and local newspapers.
Disengaged Traditionalist
Disengaged Traditionalists value a feeling of self-reliance and take pride in a hard day’s work. They believe in a well-ordered society and put a strong priority on issues of crime and justice. When they think about social and political debates, Disengaged Traditionalists often consider issues through a lens of suspicion towards others’ behaviour and observance of Britain’s social rules. While they do have viewpoints on issues, they tend to pay limited attention to public debates. They have views in common with the Loyal Nationals, but see society differently, mainly through the lens of individuals rather than groups.
Backbone Conservative
Backbone Conservatives are proud to be British and confident of their place in the world. They tend to be older and more prosperous than others, with many living in the South East.  They are nostalgic about Britain’s history, cultural heritage, and the monarchy, but looking to the future they are also the only group where a majority think that the country is going in the right direction. They are very interested in social and political issues, follow the news closely, and are stalwart supporters of the Conservative Party. Compared to most people, Backbone Conservatives are more negative on immigration, less concerned about racism, more supportive of public spending cuts and less convinced that there is a North/South divide. In addition to the BBC, their preferred sources of news are The Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph, and The Daily Express. 
Here are some examples:
Amelia Harper (Progressive Activist) - A 27-year-old single woman with no children who typically votes for the Green Party. She's empathetic, passionate, and open-minded, focusing primarily on climate change, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. Amelia was involved with Extinction Rebellion and believes that right-wing anti-net zero campaigners are "out of control" and need to be aggressively opposed. She would support Labour if she felt truly listened to and if they demonstrated a firm commitment to tackling climate change aggressively. When interacting with visitors, Amelia is neighborly and welcoming, often stepping outside and leaning on her door, ready for a friendly chat about issues that matter to her.
Jake Reynolds (Disengaged Battler) - A 25-year-old unemployed man living with his parents who has recently been drawn to Reform UK. After struggling to find steady work since graduating with a history degree, Jake has become increasingly radicalized through online men's rights forums and anti-immigration content. He believes the job market is rigged against young men and that immigration is taking opportunities from British citizens. Jake spends hours online consuming content about the "decline of masculinity" and feels that mainstream parties ignore young men's issues. He's angry, disillusioned, and searching for someone to blame. Though initially hostile when answering the door, Jake can become surprisingly engaged in political conversations that acknowledge his economic struggles. He would consider supporting Labour only if they directly addressed his concerns about male unemployment and demonstrated they weren't "pandering to woke ideology."
Amelia Richardson (Loyal Nationalist) - A 54-year-old married woman with two grown-up children who typically supports the Conservative Party but is increasingly considering Reform UK. She's prideful of British heritage and cautious of change, valuing discipline and traditional values. Her key concerns are immigration control, British sovereignty, and upholding traditional values. She would consider supporting Labour if she feels genuinely listened to and believes her children would have better life prospects under their governance, but Reform UK's strong stance on immigration appeals to her. Amelia tends to be leisurely in her interactions, taking time to exchange pleasantries when meeting others.
Jane Thompson (Progressive Activist) - A 46-year-old married woman with two teenage children who typically votes Green. She's empathetic and proactive, focusing primarily on climate change, education, and NHS issues. Jane previously participated in Extinction Rebellion and remains deeply concerned about climate collapse. She strongly opposes Reform UK's climate policies and would support Labour if she felt they prioritized environmental issues and education. When interacting with visitors, Jane tends to prioritize human connection, often putting aside her work to engage in meaningful conversation.
Brian Smith (Disengaged Traditionalist) - A 55-year-old divorced man who recently switched to supporting Reform UK after years of political disengagement. He's disillusioned, skeptical, and nostalgic, with primary concerns about immigration and unemployment. Brian blames his lack of job success for his divorce and believes Britain should close its borders. Reform UK's anti-immigration messaging resonates strongly with him. Despite his cynical worldview, Brian surprisingly greets visitors joyfully, often using humor as a social buffer.
Colin Marks (Disengaged Battler) - A 42-year-old divorced man who now supports Reform UK after previously having no political affiliation. He's skeptical, traditional, and cautious, with primary concerns about job security and immigration. Colin worries about his own employment prospects as wages in his trade have been stagnant for a long time. He was drawn to Reform UK's promises about protecting British jobs and limiting immigration. Despite his challenges, Colin greets visitors joyfully, often with laughter or jokes that set a friendly mood.
Sarah Canes (Civic Pragmatist) - A 34-year-old single woman cohabiting with her partner who typically votes Green or Liberal Democrat. She's compassionate, eco-conscious and open-minded, with particular concern for climate change, gender equality, and animal welfare. Sarah has two rescue dogs from a shelter, highlighting her commitment to animal rights. She actively opposes Reform UK's policies and would support Labour if she felt listened to and if they demonstrated understanding of animal welfare issues. When answering the door, Sarah often appears busy, balancing various items and indicating she has little time to chat.
Emma Richardson (Established Liberal) - A 34-year-old single woman who typically votes Liberal Democrat. She's empathetic, outspoken, and proactive, with key concerns about climate change, gender equality, and mental health awareness. Emma has struggled with anxiety herself and volunteers for a mental health helpline. She strongly rejects Reform UK's platform and would support Labour if she felt they would take substantive action on mental health issues. When greeting visitors, Emma shows sincere enthusiasm, eager to engage in conversation.
George Hastings (Loyal Nationalist) - A 62-year-old widower with three adult children who has shifted from traditionally voting Labour to now supporting Reform UK. As a veteran, he's stoic, patriotic, and values respect and order, with key concerns about veterans' rights, strong national defense, and upholding British traditions. George believes Reform UK better represents his patriotic values. He feels too many young people today don't understand what it means to fight for one's country. He would only return to supporting Labour if he felt they respected veterans like himself and their contributions to national safety.`;
